## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([retext][]) plugin to check for the passive
voice.
It checks for certain verbs (`'am'`, `'are'`, `'were'`, `'being'`, `'is'`,
`'been'`, `'was'`, or `'be'`), followed by a word in [`list.js`][list].

## When should I use this?

You can opt-into this plugin when you’re dealing with content that might contain
weak language, and have authors that can fix that content.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, or 18.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install retext-passive
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import retextPassive from 'https://esm.sh/retext-passive@4'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import retextPassive from 'https://esm.sh/retext-passive@4?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our document `example.txt` contains:

```txt
He was withheld while we were being fed.
```

…and our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import retextEnglish from 'retext-english'
import retextPassive from 'retext-passive'
import retextStringify from 'retext-stringify'

const file = await unified()
  .use(retextEnglish)
  .use(retextPassive)
  .use(retextStringify)
  .process(await read('example.txt'))

console.error(reporter(file))
```

…now running `node example.js` yields:

```txt
example.txt
   1:8-1:16  warning  Don’t use the passive voice  withheld  retext-passive
  1:37-1:40  warning  Don’t use the passive voice  fed       retext-passive

⚠ 2 warnings
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `retextPassive`.

### `unified().use(retextPassive[, options])`

Check for the passive voice.

##### `options`

Configuration (optional).

###### `options.ignore`

Phrases *not* to warn about (`Array<string>`).

## Messages

Each message is emitted as a [`VFileMessage`][vfile-message] on `file`, with
the following fields:

###### `message.source`

Name of this plugin (`'retext-passive'`).

###### `message.ruleId`

Any word in [`list.js`][list].

###### `message.actual`

Current not ok phrase (`string`).

###### `message.expected`

Empty array to signal that `actual` should be removed (`[]`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type `Options`.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, and 18.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
